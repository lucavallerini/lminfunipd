	Abstract = {In this paper, we provide some insight and background into the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) specifications as available from 3GPP and in draft version also from MPEG. Specifically, the 3GPP version provides a normative description of a Media Presentation, the formats of a Segment, and the deliv- ery protocol. In addition, it adds an informative description on how a DASH Client may use the provided information to establish a streaming service for the user. The solution supports different service types (e.g., On-Demand, Live, Time-Shift Viewing), different features (e.g., adaptive bitrate switching, multiple lan- guage support, ad insertion, trick modes, DRM) and different deployment options. Design principles and examples are provid- ed.},

abstract={This paper proposes a Quality of Experience (QoE) test methodology for adaptive streaming service. We analyze the factors influencing the QoE of adaptive streaming, and evaluate the QoE of the end-to-end service. Our research gives the evidence that adaptive streaming improves end-users' subjective perception greatly compared with fixed-rate streaming in terms of QoE. Two groups of experiments are conducted, one assesses artificially spliced video samples in variable bitrates, and another evaluates Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) [1] [2] video samples under real network traces. The former experiment focuses on the influence from the bitrate distribution without considering the fluency. And the latter pays more attention to the influence of the fluency on QoE performance. Through a large number of subjective assessments, the QoE results are obtained to illustrate various impact factors on adaptive streaming, such as fluency, bitrate distribution, startup bitrate level, bitrate switching frequency, etc. The results of this study can be used to facilitate the research on mathematical modeling of user subjective experience and the algorithm development for adaptive streaming.},

abstract={Live and on-demand video streaming has recently contributed a significant part of the Internet traffic. In order to guarantee the best possible user experience, multimedia service is required to support large fluctuations in different network conditions. One of the cost effective means for multimedia delivery nowadays is HTTP streaming. The key challenge of this technology is how to change adaptively video bitrates according to network variation and client buffer while bestowing upon users the best possible video quality. In this paper, we propose a novel rate-adaptation method on client side, which allows clients to estimate buffer level in the future, and thus achieving a balance between the need for high video quality and buffer stability. The experiments show that our method performs well under varying network conditions.},

abstract={Internet video makes up a significant part of the Internet traffic and its fraction is constantly growing. In order to guarantee best user experience throughout different network access technologies with dynamically varying network conditions, it is fundamental to adopt technologies enabling a proper delivery of the media content. One of such technologies is adaptive streaming. It allows to dynamically adapt the bit-rate of the stream to varying network conditions. There are various approaches to adaptive streaming. In our work, we focus on the receiver-driven approach where the media file is subdivided into segments, each of the segments is provided at multiple bit-rates, and the task of the client is to select the appropriate bit-rate for each of the segments. With this approach, the challenges are (i) to properly estimate the dynamics of the available network throughput, (ii) to control the filling level of the client buffer in order to avoid underflows resulting in playback interruptions, (iii) to maximize the quality of the stream, while avoiding unnecessary quality fluctuations, and, finally, (iv) to minimize the delay between the user's request and the start of the playback. During our work, we designed and implemented a receiver-driven adaptation algorithm for adaptive streaming that does not rely on cross-layer information or server assistance. We integrated the algorithm with a prototype implementation of a streaming client based on the MPEG DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) standard. We evaluated the implemented prototype in real-world scenarios and found that it performes remarkably well even under challenging network conditions. Further, it exhibits stable and fair operation if a common link is shared among multiple clients.},

abstract={HTTP streaming has become a cost effective means for multimedia delivery nowadays. In this paper, we study the use of MPEG DASH standard to stream audiovisual content. We first describe a novel estimation method for connection throughput. Then, employing the extensibility feature of DASH syntax, we present a systematic method for selecting the best audio and video alternatives given the estimated throughput. The experiments show that our solution is stable to short-term fluctuations while responding quickly to large fluctuations.},
